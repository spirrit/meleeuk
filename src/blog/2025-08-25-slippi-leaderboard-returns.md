I've revived the long forgotten Slippi leaderboards after not updating them for over *2 years*. Rejoice my fellow ranked enthusiasts, for you now have a place to call home.

It took bloody ages to do, the repo I forked it from changed their method for updating the leaderboard and didn't document it very well. I had to just figure it out, which took hours and it was pretty simple in the end which is kinda funny. Would have saved me bashing my head against a wall if it was documented in any way though. I should probably contribute a change to their readme honestly, in the spirit of collaboration.

I started to tidy up some of the other dusty parts of the site today. I want to get the events page in proper order, and sort out the code for my rankings page to make it nice and lovely before I add the PRs it's missing. I'm unsure about future plans but the wheels on this bus have begun to move again, rusty as fuck though they may be.

A quick shout-out Zepple for emailing me asking to update the Slippi page. I probably wouldn't be writing this otherwise. `congrats on grandmaster :)`
