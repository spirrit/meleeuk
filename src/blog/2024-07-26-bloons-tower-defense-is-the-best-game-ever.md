I love this game. I love shooting the ballons.

The dart monkeys know what's up, they are prepared to combat the unfeeling balloon scourge. I've always hated balloons, that's why I decided to join the ranks against them. A balloon killed my father and now I will exact vengeance on all bloon-kind.

This is better than a lorem ipsum right? Sometimes you don't want to just generate 5 paragraphs of slop, you want to WRITE AN EPIC. I would say you're unprepared for the plot twists that are soon to come, but we both know that even I don't know what kind of twist waits at the end of this meandering sentence.

It turns out I was a bloon all along.
