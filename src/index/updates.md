We're looking at adding a slippi leaderboard, though it might take some time to make. It should function similarly to Swish's version, with a way to add yourself, and a few new features.

I'd like to add some form of blog/cms for the website so we can write articles and updates on important scene happenings, as well as some writings about the game. The main priority right now though is getting rid of everything that says "test".
