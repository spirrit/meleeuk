We're looking at adding a slippi leaderboard, though it might take some time to make. It should function similarly to Swish's version, with a way to add yourself, and a few new features.

I'd like to add some form of blog/cms for the website, so we can write articles and updates on important melee happenings. The main priority right now though is getting rid of everything that says "test".
